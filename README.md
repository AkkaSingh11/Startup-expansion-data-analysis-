Problem Statement:
A small-town startup is based in different cities of the U.S.A. and I have tried to analyse their revenues and sales, Marketing spend and the comaprison between sales of two regions.There is an additional dataset of U.S. Population census and I have tried to co-relate future expansion with population since, in this startup, sales are directly proportional to target customers.By joining these datasets, I have analysed whether it is advisable to open a new store in a region or not based on these factors. In the end, I have made a dashboard highlighting these visualizations.
CONCLUSION:
1- Region 1 outperforms Region 2 in all three parameters(Higher average revenue, Lesser marketing spend and higher average ROMI.)
2- Based on cluster analysis done on data points of all stores, cluster 1( see chart) is the best cluster to open a new store, the higher slope of trend lines show that they have a higher chance of being profitable.
